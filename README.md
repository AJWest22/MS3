MS3 README

OVERVIEW:
This site was created for MS3 submission for Code Institute.
The site's name is Book Recommendations.
The source code can be found on GitHub
The site is deployed using Heroku

The purpose of this site is to help people find books they might like to read in a particular genre, and leave 
recommendations on books they have read and would recommend. Users can browse the site and read the "Quick Picks" 
recommendations, but must be logged in to add a review, edit, and delete a review. 

There are currently two types of accounts at the moment:

**Username**: Reader **Password**: Reader

and 

**Username**: Admin **Password** Admin

Both accounts are test accounts used to test site functionality, for example: 
Reader was used to check if accounts were showing on the Database, and Admin was used to check if only reviews added by admin could be edited by admin. 


UX GOALS:

Users can create, edit and delete reviews, and browse recommendations by others.

OWNERS GOALS:

Provide a service that encourages people to read, and find good books.

ABOUT THE SITE:

The site has a total of 9 pages. Some are only visible to users who are logged in (profile page for example).
Users who are logged in have the option to add, edit and delete their reviews, while those who aren't logged in
can only browse other people's reviews.
